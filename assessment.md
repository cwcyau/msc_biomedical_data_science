# Assessment map

This assessment map indicates the methods used to assess students on the programme. All modules are listed and an ‘F’ is used to indicate that a formative assessment of that type is used, or an ‘S’ to indicate that a summative assessment (i.e. contributing to the module mark) is used. 

e.g.
