# Programme Proposal

## Qualification(s) and programme title

Masters (MSc) in Biomedical Data Science

## Mode(s) of study

Full-time only 

## Programme Length

9 months

## Expected Start 

October

## English Language

Higher level required.

## Course Overview

This MSc programme will provide a broad and deep taught introduction into many dimensions of modern biomedical data science. It will differs from existing Masters-level data science courses by focusing on elements which are most important for biomedical applications and linking to relevant biomedical problems throughout based around local research expertise within the institution. The course is designed for exceptional graduate students, primarily moving from non-biomedical science domains, and who are seeking to enter further postgraduate research study in biomedical data science.

It is designed as a 9-month course to enable more diverse participation in course delivery.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course, the students should be able to:

- recall a range of analytical and computer-intensive methods applicable to biomedical data science,
- demonstrate the ability to reformulate biomedical research questions into mathematical and/or computational problems,
- choose and adapt appropriate analytical and computational methods to identify solutions,
- formulate and implement their analysis approach on real-world data sets,
- communicate their results clearly and succinctly to a broad audience both orally and in written form,
- understand the wider social and ethical complexities of biomedical research and place their research in context.

## Expected entry requirements

Entrants are expected to have high-level proficiency in the following:

1. Foundational mathematical topics including calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics.
2. Pre-existing programming skills in a modern language (including Python, C/C++, Java).

This is likely to be achieved through undergraduate studies in quantitative subjects (e.g. mathematics, computer science, physics and engineering) at a minimum of 2.1 (or equivalent level) but likely to be at first-class (or equivalent). 

Applicants will be expected to take an admissions test interrogating these skills.

## Course Structure

There will be 6 compulsory modules (total: 100 credits), 2 optional modules (total: 40 credits) and a final research dissertation (total: 40 credits).
